  /*! \class RobotTeleportation
   * \brief The task context provides and requires services. It uses an ExecutionEngine to perform its functions.
   * Essential interfaces are operations, data flow ports and properties. These interfaces have been defined using the oroGen specification.
   * In order to modify the interfaces you should (re)use oroGen and rely on the associated workflow.
   *
   * \details
   * The name of a TaskContext is primarily defined via:
   \verbatim
   deployment 'deployment_name'
       task('custom_task_name','mars::RobotTeleportation')
   end
   \endverbatim
   *  It can be dynamically adapted when the deployment is called with a prefix argument.
